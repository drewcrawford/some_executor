//! Global executor management for program-wide task execution.
//! 
//! This module provides functionality for setting and accessing a global executor
//! that persists for the entire lifetime of the program. This is useful when you
//! need to spawn tasks from contexts where you cannot easily pass an executor
//! as a parameter, such as signal handlers or global initialization code.
//! 
//! # Overview
//! 
//! The global executor pattern allows you to:
//! - Set a single executor for the entire program using [`set_global_executor`]
//! - Access this executor from anywhere using [`global_executor`]
//! - Spawn tasks without needing to thread an executor through your call stack
//! 
//! # Important Considerations
//! 
//! - The global executor can only be set once. Attempting to set it multiple times
//!   will panic.
//! - You must initialize the global executor before attempting to use it. Accessing
//!   an uninitialized global executor will return `None`.
//! - For most use cases, [`crate::current_executor::current_executor`] is preferred
//!   as it provides more flexibility and context-aware executor selection.
//! 
//! # Example Usage
//! 
//! ```no_run
//! use some_executor::global_executor::{set_global_executor, global_executor};
//! use some_executor::DynExecutor;
//! 
//! // Initialize the global executor early in your program
//! let executor: Box<DynExecutor> = todo!(); // Your executor implementation
//! set_global_executor(executor);
//! 
//! // Later, from anywhere in your program
//! global_executor(|e| {
//!     if let Some(executor) = e {
//!         // Use the executor
//!         let mut executor = executor.clone_box();
//!         // spawn tasks...
//!     }
//! });
//! ```

/// Accesses the global executor through a callback function.
/// 
/// This function provides safe access to the global executor (if one has been set)
/// through a callback pattern. The callback receives an `Option<&DynExecutor>` which
/// will be `Some` if a global executor has been initialized, or `None` otherwise.
/// 
/// # Arguments
/// 
/// * `c` - A closure that receives `Option<&DynExecutor>` and returns a value of type `R`
/// 
/// # Returns
/// 
/// Whatever value the callback function returns.
/// 
/// # Usage Patterns
/// 
/// ## Cloning the executor for task spawning
/// 
/// ```no_run
/// use some_executor::global_executor::global_executor;
/// use some_executor::task::{Task, ConfigurationBuilder};
/// 
/// let mut executor = global_executor(|e| {
///     e.expect("Global executor not initialized").clone_box()
/// });
/// 
/// // Now you can spawn tasks
/// let task = Task::without_notifications(
///     "my-task".to_string(),
///     async { 42 },
///     ConfigurationBuilder::new().build()
/// );
/// # // executor.spawn(task);
/// ```
/// 
/// ## Checking if executor is available
/// 
/// ```
/// use some_executor::global_executor::global_executor;
/// 
/// let is_available = global_executor(|e| e.is_some());
/// if !is_available {
///     println!("Global executor not initialized");
/// }
/// ```
/// 
/// ## Spawning with fallback
/// 
/// ```
/// use some_executor::global_executor::global_executor;
/// use some_executor::current_executor::current_executor;
/// 
/// // Try global executor, fall back to current executor
/// let mut executor = global_executor(|e| {
///     e.map(|exec| exec.clone_box())
/// }).unwrap_or_else(|| current_executor());
/// ```
/// 
/// # Important Notes
/// 
/// - The global executor must be initialized with [`set_global_executor`] before use
/// - For most use cases, prefer [`crate::current_executor::current_executor`] which
///   provides more flexible executor discovery
/// - The callback pattern ensures thread-safe access to the global executor
pub fn global_executor<R>(c: impl FnOnce(Option<&DynExecutor>) -> R) -> R {
    let e = GLOBAL_RUNTIME.get();
    c(e.map(|e| &**e))
}

/// Sets the global executor for the entire program.
/// 
/// This function initializes the global executor that will be available throughout
/// the program's lifetime. Once set, the executor can be accessed from anywhere
/// using [`global_executor`].
/// 
/// # Arguments
/// 
/// * `runtime` - A boxed [`DynExecutor`] that will serve as the global executor
/// 
/// # Panics
/// 
/// This function will panic if called more than once. The global executor can only
/// be initialized once during the program's lifetime.
/// 
/// # Example
/// 
/// ```no_run
/// use some_executor::global_executor::set_global_executor;
/// use some_executor::DynExecutor;
/// 
/// // Early in your program initialization
/// fn init_executor() {
///     let executor: Box<DynExecutor> = todo!(); // Your executor implementation
///     set_global_executor(executor);
/// }
/// ```
/// 
/// # Best Practices
/// 
/// - Call this function early in your program's initialization, ideally in `main()`
///   or during startup
/// - Ensure the executor is fully configured before setting it as the global executor
/// - Consider whether you actually need a global executor - in many cases,
///   [`crate::current_executor`] provides a more flexible solution
/// 
/// # Thread Safety
/// 
/// This function is thread-safe and uses internal synchronization. However, it should
/// typically be called from a single initialization point to avoid race conditions
/// where multiple threads attempt to set the global executor.
