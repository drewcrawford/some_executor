/*!
A fallback static executor that provides a guaranteed async runtime when no other executors are available.

This module implements `StaticLastResortExecutor`, a minimal but compliant static executor that serves
as the ultimate fallback in the `some_executor` hierarchy. When no production-quality static executor
is configured, this executor ensures that static async code can still run, albeit with significant
performance limitations.

# Design Philosophy

The `StaticLastResortExecutor` is intentionally designed to be the simplest possible executor that
still correctly implements the `SomeStaticExecutor` trait. It prioritizes correctness and availability
over performance, making it suitable only for development, testing, or emergency fallback scenarios.

# Implementation Strategy

This executor uses a synchronous, blocking approach:
- Tasks are executed immediately and synchronously on the calling thread
- No actual concurrent execution occurs - everything runs sequentially
- Platform-specific synchronization primitives (condvar/mutex on std, busy-waiting on WASM)
- Emits warnings when used to alert developers about the performance implications

# When This Executor Is Used

The static last resort executor activates when:
1. No global static executor has been configured via `set_static_executor()`
2. No thread-local static executor is available
3. Code attempts to spawn a static future without proper executor setup

# Performance Characteristics

**Warning**: This executor is NOT intended for production use. It has severe limitations:
- **No concurrency**: All tasks run synchronously, blocking the calling thread
- **Poor scalability**: Each spawn blocks until the task completes
- **High overhead**: Uses heavyweight synchronization primitives for simple polling
- **No work stealing**: Tasks cannot be distributed across threads
- **No I/O optimization**: Blocking I/O will block the entire executor

# Platform Differences

## Standard Platforms (non-WASM)
Uses `std::sync::Condvar` and `std::sync::Mutex` for wake notifications, providing
efficient blocking waits when futures return `Poll::Pending`.

## WASM32
Falls back to busy-waiting or platform-specific primitives since standard blocking
primitives are not available in browser environments.

# Example

```
// This example shows when the last resort executor would be used.
// In production, you should configure a proper executor instead.

use some_executor::thread_executor::thread_static_executor;

// When no executor is set, the last resort executor is used automatically
thread_static_executor(|executor| {
    // This executor will be the last resort if none was configured
    // It prints a warning to stderr when used

    // The StaticLastResortExecutor is an internal implementation detail
    // that gets invoked automatically as a fallback
    println!("Using executor: {:?}", std::any::type_name_of_val(executor));
});
```

# Alternatives

For production use, consider these alternatives:
- Configure a global static executor at application startup
- Use thread-local executors for isolated execution contexts
- Integrate with established runtimes like Tokio or async-std

> Cut my tasks into pieces, this is my last resort!
> Async handling, no tokio, don't give a fuck if performance is bleeding
> this is my last resort

/// A minimal static executor that runs tasks synchronously as a last resort fallback.
///
/// This executor provides a compliant implementation of [`SomeStaticExecutor`] but with
/// severe performance limitations. It's designed to ensure that async code can always
/// run, even when no production executor is configured.
///
/// # Warning
///
/// This executor is NOT suitable for production use. It executes all tasks synchronously
/// on the calling thread, providing no actual concurrency. A warning is printed to stderr
/// (or console on WASM) whenever this executor is used.
///
/// # Implementation Details
///
/// When a task is spawned:
/// 1. The task is immediately executed synchronously using platform-specific primitives
/// 2. The executor blocks until the task completes
/// 3. An observer handle is returned for compatibility, but the task has already finished
///
/// # Thread Safety
///
/// `StaticLastResortExecutor` is `Clone` and can be safely shared between threads.
/// However, each spawn operation blocks the calling thread until completion, so
/// concurrent spawns from different threads will effectively serialize.
///
/// # Memory Safety
///
/// The executor properly handles task lifetimes and waker management through the
/// platform-specific `run_static_task` implementation, ensuring no use-after-free
